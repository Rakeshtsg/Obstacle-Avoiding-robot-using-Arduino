An algorithm for obstacle avoidance in a robot using ultrasonic sensors can be implemented using the following steps:

Mount ultrasonic sensors on the robot, with one sensor facing forward and others placed at different angles to provide a 360-degree view of the robot's surroundings.

Continuously poll the sensors to measure the distance to any obstacles in the robot's environment.

Create a map of the environment and the location of the obstacles within it, using the distance measurements from the sensors.

Use path planning algorithms, such as A* or Dijkstra's algorithm, to determine a safe and efficient path for the robot to navigate around the obstacles.

Use motion planning algorithms to calculate the specific movements and actions the robot needs to take to follow the determined path and avoid the obstacles.

Continuously monitor the robot's surroundings using the sensors and update the map and path as needed to account for any changes in the environment or the movement of the obstacles.

Implement control systems to execute the calculated movements and actions, allowing the robot to smoothly and accurately avoid obstacles as it navigates through its environment.
